In this thesis, the author developed the calculation method presented in Chapter \ref{methods} and performed all of the density functional theory and Bader theory calculations for the results presented in Chapter \ref{results}.  The author also performed all of the analysis and processing of the experimental spectra.  The lithium K edge experimental spectra in Chapters \ref{literature_review} and \ref{results}, as well as the carbon K edge spectra in Figure \ref{carbon-k-edge} were obtained by Nicolas Brodusch and Fr\'ed\'eric Voisard.  Prof. Raynald Gauvin and Prof. George P. Demopoulos supervised the research project.
