The study of lithium materials has become increasingly relevant in recent years \cite{nitta_li-ion_2015}.  In particular, the field has been driven by the need to develop improved  and more cost effective battery materials \cite{nitta_li-ion_2015}.  In large part, this drive has come from increasing demands for electric vehicles and portable electrical devices demanding longer lifetimes and faster charging.  All aspects of lithium ion batteries are currently being improved, yet theoretical limits have not yet been achieved in an array of properties including capacity, charge density, and charge/discharge rates. \\


As the third element on the periodic table, lithium has a range of properties that offer performance advances compared to other battery materials.  Its low mass and high charge density allow for lithium ion batteries to be smaller and lighter without sacrificing lifetime.  Lithium's small ion size makes it highly mobile, which leads to superior discharge rates.   Furthermore, as an alkali earth metal with a single weakly bound valence electron, lithium is highly electropositive.   As a result, lithium ion batteries can achieve higher operating voltages than alternatives such as nickle-cadmium or lead-acid batteries \cite{etacheri_challenges_2011}.  These comparative performance advantages to these alternatives are illustrated in Fig \ref{ragone} \cite{etacheri_challenges_2011}.\\

The pursuit of further improving the performance of lithium batteries has shifted analysis of these materials increasingly towards measuring microstructure properties \cite{lu_lithium_2012,arthur_spontaneous_2016, muller_quantification_2018}. Identifying microscale features such as crystal structure, diffusion mechanics, and composition is an essential component of characterizing new battery materials \cite{van_der_ven_first-principles_2001}.  Electron microscopy is a central technique for probing features on these length scales, due to high spatial resolution and increasing accessibility   \cite{chiu_aqueous_2013,inkson_2_2016, hansen_atomic-resolution_2001}. \\

Lithium materials present a range of challenges to electron microscopy.  Battery materials are becoming increasingly intricate and lithium's light weight and ionizable nature make it particularly sensitive to electron beams \cite{kobayashi_quantitative_2017}.  These properties limit analysis largely to low dosage techniques that better suited for light elements, such as electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) \cite{Egerton}.  Even using low dosage techniques, beam damage remains problematic, requiring the recent development of low voltage EELS to make lithium analysis possible \cite{SU_9000}.  To support this combination of new techniques and beam sensitivity a degree of theoretical support is required.  
\\

Theoretical support for EELS  comes most predominantly from methods based in density functional theory (DFT).  DFT is a first principles approach that requires only the locations of atoms in a crystal to determine material properties \cite{ks_1965, wien2k,elk,exciting, vasp}.  As in experiment, lithium's lightweight nature complicates DFT and results have been limited to qualitative findings \cite{mauchamp_ab_2006, mauchamp_local_2008}. Much of the challenge in simulating EELS for lithium lies in the treatment of the electron hole created in excited atoms.  Lithium's few electrons mean that effects from the hole will almost always be present in the spectra and current methods in literature lack the subtlety to treat these effects. \\

The goal of this work is to calculate meaningful EELS spectra of lithium materials, specifically in the unprecedented context of EELS at 30 keV. This is accomplished be improving the treatment of core electron holes of lithium in DFT simulations. \\

The outline of this thesis is as follows: in Chapter \ref{literature_review} presents an overview of EELS, DFT and theoretical EELS calculations.  Chapter \ref{methods} describes the improved method developed in this work, and Chapter \ref{results} applies the method to a number of lithium materials.  Chapter \ref{conclusion} concludes the results and addresses future work.
